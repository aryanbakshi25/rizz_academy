                <p>Rizz Academy is an institution that improves individuals' rizz. Students must be 16 or older, there is no limit to how high the age range can go, we pair students in their age class so there is plenty of separation. Rizz actually comes from the word charisma. It means "spitting game" or the ability to "pull". Rizz is defined as skill in charming or seducing a potential romantic partner. Rizz Academy enhances your strengths and improves your rizz. If you graduate from the academy and don't have a baddie within 2 years, you get half of your tuition money back.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We are in our first year of production so you all are lucky enough to be the academy's first alumni! For you to be get consideration from us, you must take our <a href="final.html" target="_blank">RIZZPLACEMENT TEST</a> and achieve a score of 5 or more, if you're below that, there's no hope for you.

            <p>To be admitted into Rizz Academy, you must be an ambitious student willing to hear opinions and criticisms from multiple perspectives. At times you will realize how down bad you are but that's okay because the academy will help you improve yourself. We require an above average GPA throughout your years and shown personal interest in the field of "pulling". This can be done through proof of sliding into dms or attempts of rizz in any legal and ethical form. After all, we don't want students that aren't ready to better themselves nor those who aren't willing to work with discipline towards their goal.</p>
            <p>Like the SAT for most colleges, we require you to take our <a href="final.html" target="_blank">RIZZPLACEMENT TEST</a> and achieve a score of 5 or more for considerstion into the academy, if you're below that, there's no hope for you.</p>

Or features men notice first about women, like their hair. Although not always objective, you will learn mostly general standards here. </p>
            <p>If you've paid for time with one person, you will either be assigned a professor or a TA, both are extraordinary and will be the person that you can talk about anything with. These are the people that you can tell your situation with someone. The professors or TAs will not judge you more than academically required. They will help you with your specfic situation and condition. However, if you do something illegal, they will be obligated to notify authorities. This is just for everyone's safe being.</p>
